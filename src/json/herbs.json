It has an essential oil content between .5% and 2.5%. Cracked Rosemary is also called cracked rosemary leaves, dried rosemary leaves, dried rosemary, or bulk rosemary. Rosemary has been long known throughout history. Used in medicinal treatments since 500 BCE, it was believed to be a cure for jaundice, migraines, inflammation, and other ailments in Greece and Rome. During the Middle Ages, rosemary was thought to have the power to ward off thieves, infidelity, nightmares, and even boost memory. HOL Cracked Rosemary is popular with seasoning companies, American restaurants, brewpubs, delis, food trucks, spice and olive oil shops, and manufacturers of bloody mary mix, sauces, and specialty sodas. We also offer Ground Rosemary and Organic Cracked Rosemary. 1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary = 1 teaspoon of fresh rosemary.",

We use it for drinks, wonderful flavor, hot we use it for opening up our breathing and it smells great. We did not get it as a sample but ordered what we call a large amount. We like to rely on natural means for healing, with COPD, allergies, etc. this is great. We put some in a coffee filter, staple it and put it under our pillow, helps at night."

        "description": "Dried Parsley, Petroselinum crispum, is a bright, refreshing herb. It is a member of the Apiaceae or Umbelliferae family of plants, which includes herbs and spices like dill, chervil, anise, fennel, cumin, caraway, coriander, and even the pungent resin, asafoetida. Parsley is also referred to as parsley flakes, dry parsley, dried parsley leaves, and parsley spice. Our Dried Parsley is made from curly parsley, which typically contains between .06% and .1% essential oil in its leaves, which concentrates as the leaves dry. It is bright green and somewhat flaky. Bulk dried parsley is often purchased by seasoning companies, oil and spice shops, and food manufacturers that specialize in products like gourmet jams, gourmet condiments, jerky, pickling, and even dog food. It’s also popular with Italian restaurants food trucks, delicatessens, and restaurants with a predominantly salad-based menu. Parsley is voluminous; there are approximately 14.5 cups of dried parsley per pound. Order accordingly. We also offer Ground Parsley and Organic Parsley.",
        "howto": "Dried Parsley adds a terrific herbal lift to ground meats, so roll into Glazed Meatballs, a Grilled Turkey Burger, or the lamb-and-beef combo of a Kofte Kebab. It adds brightness to vegetarian dishes like Falafel and Savory Stuffed Mushrooms. It’s great on delicate flavors, like a mild white fish in Lemon Parmesan Fish And Asparagus. It’s also a welcome way to cut through heavier flavors, so use it when you make a gravy-rich Pennsylvania Dutch Chicken Pot Pie. Toss over dishes like Grilled Vegetable Pasta as a garnish, or over any vegetables that you want. It’s great on your favorite homemade pizza. You can cover Dried Parsley with olive oil and let it infuse to make parsley oil for vinaigrettes or as a finisher for soups. Mix with garlic, lemon, and mayonnaise for an herb aioli. ",

        "description": "File Powder is also known as gumbo file or ground sassafras leaves. Pronounced “FEE-lay,” our File Powder is an herbal thickening agent made primarily from ground sassafras leaves. Sassafras leaves have an essential oil content of about 2% to 3% and exude a natural mucilage, the thickener that gives the powder its name. File Powder is a blend of ground sassafras powder, ground oregano, and ground thyme. It is popular with seasoning companies; independent spice shops; brewpubs; seafood restaurants; breweries; and manufacturers of sausages and kettlecorn or popcorn. ",
        "howto": "File Powder should be used sparingly as it is very potent. If you add too much, cook it for too long, or cook it at too high a heat, your dish will likely turn stringy and gummy. It is most commonly used to thicken gumbos, like this hearty Chicken and Sausage Gumbo. File Powder can also be used to season shrimp and grits, and stews like crawfish etouffee. It can be a recipe rescue if you have a chowder that’s too milky or need to add that extra heft to vegetable gravy. Use it as a thickener instead of roux, but be prepared for the final product to reflect the flavor of the changed ingredients.",
